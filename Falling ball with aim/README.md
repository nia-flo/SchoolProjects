# Falling ball with aim

This is a small game, in which you should touch the red ball with the gray one. The player sets the starting coordinates (X and Y), the speed and the angle (in degrees) of the gray ball. It starts moving at the given direction, but is affected by the gravity. The player wins when the gray ball hits the red one.
